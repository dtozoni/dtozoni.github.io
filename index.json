Optimized objects can be more than 10x stronger, verified both in simulations and 3D-printed physical experiments Microstructure Mapping and Optimization: designed technique to smoothly map material properties to microstructure geometry, which allows us to build compliant 3D-printable objects using a single material from curved and non-regular quad meshes. Our technique was compared to other state-of-the-art techniques, showing significant better results Solving the Art Gallery Problem: developed new algorithm and software solution in C++ for optimally solving the Art Gallery Problem (AGP). The new algorithm is able to find guaranteed optimal solutions for instances of thousands of vertices in a matter of minutes, something not possible before, when algorithms had issues with polygons of dozens of vertices.

However, most existing shape optimization methods focus on single parts. In this work, we focus on supporting shape optimization for assemblies, more specifically, assemblies that are held together by contact and friction. Examples of which include furniture joints, construction set assemblies, certain types of prosthetic devices and many other. To enable this optimization, we present a framework supporting robust and accurate optimization of a number of important functionals, while enforcing constraints essential for assembly functionality: weight, stress, difficulty of putting the assembly together, and how reliably it stays together. Our framework is based on smoothed formulation of elasticity equations with contact, analytically derived shape derivatives, and robust remeshing to enable large changes of shape, and at the same time, maintain accuracy. We demonstrate the improvements it can achieve for a number of computational and experimental examples.","tags":["additive fabrication","deformable objects","shape optimization"],"title":"Optimizing contact-based assemblies","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Davi Colli Tozoni","Âê≥ÊÅ©ÈÅî"],"categories":["Demo","ÊïôÁ®ã"],"content":"Overview  The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

One important application of complex fine-scale geometric structures is to create variable effective elastic material properties in shapes manufactured from a single material. Modification of material properties has a variety of uses, from aerospace applications to soft robotics and prosthetic devices. Due to its scalability and effectiveness, an increasingly common approach to creating spatially varying materials is to partition a shape into cells and use a parametric family of small-scale geometric structures with known effective properties to fill the cells. We propose a new approach to solving this problem for extruded, planar microstructures. Differently from existing methods for two-scale optimization based on regular grids with square periodic cells, which cannot conform to an arbitrary boundary, we introduce cell decompositions consisting of (nearly) rhombic cells. These meshes have far greater flexibility than those with square cells in terms of approximating arbitrary shapes, and, at the same time, have a number of properties simplifying small-scale structure construction. Our main contributions include a new family of 2D cell geometry structures, explicitly parameterized by their effective Young's moduli E, Poisson's ratios v, and rhombic angle Œ± with the geometry parameters expressed directly as smooth spline functions of E, v, and Œ±. This family leads to smooth transitions between the tiles and can handle a broad range of rhombic cell shapes. We introduce a complete material design pipeline based on this microstructure family, composed of an algorithm to generate rhombic tessellation from quadrilateral meshes and an algorithm to synthesize the microstructure geometry. We fabricated a number of models and experimentally demonstrated how our method, in combination with material optimization, can be used to achieve the desired deformation behavior.","tags":["additive fabrication","deformable objects","homogenization","microstructures","shape optimization"],"title":"A low-parametric rhombic microstructure family for irregular lattices","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34; if porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;)   Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three   A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026#34;/media/boards.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026#34;#0000FF\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026#34;my-style\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}}   Custom CSS Example Let‚Äôs make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }   Questions?

Specifically, we consider composites with isotropic homogenized elasticity tensor, obtained as a mixture of two isotropic materials. We focus on the case when one material has zero stiffness, i.e., single-material structures with voids. This problem is important, in particular, in the context of designing small-scale structures for metamaterials that can be manufactured using additive fabrication. A range of effective metamaterial properties can be obtained this way using a single base material. We demonstrate that two closely related simple parametric families based on the structure proposed by Sigmund in [26] attain good coverage of the space of isotropic properties satisfying Hashin‚ÄìShtrikman bounds. In particular, for positive Poisson‚Äôs ratio, we demonstrate that Hashin‚ÄìShtrikman bound can be approximated arbitrarily well, within limits imposed by numerical approximation: a strong evidence that these bounds are achievable in this case. For negative Poisson‚Äôs ratios, we numerically obtain a bound which we hypothesize to be close to optimal, at least for metamaterials with rotational symmetries of a regular triangle tiling.","tags":[],"title":"A parametric class of composites with a large achievable range of effective elastic properties","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Davi C.

Many of these solutions use Integer Linear Programming (ILP) modeling and rely on state-of-the- art solvers to be able to find optimal solutions for large instances in a matter of minutes. In this work, we discuss an ILP-based algorithm that solves to optimality the Art Gallery Problem (AGP), one of the most studied problems in computational geometry. The basic idea of our method is to iteratively generate upper and lower bounds for the problem through the resolution of discretized versions of the AGP, which are reduced to instances of the Set Cover Problem. Our algorithm was implemented and tested on almost 3,000 instances and attained optimal solutions for the vast majority of them, greatly increasing the set of instances for which exact solutions are known. To the best of our knowledge, in spite of the extensive study of the AGP in the last four decades, no other algorithm has shown the ability to solve the AGP as effectively and efficiently as the one described here. Evidence of its robustness is presented through tests done on a number of classes of polygons of various sizes with and without holes. A software package implementing the algorithm is made available.","tags":["Art gallery problem","combinatorial optimization","computational geometry","exact algorithm"],"title":"Algorithm 966: A Practical Iterative Algorithm for the Art Gallery Problem Using Integer Linear Programming","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
