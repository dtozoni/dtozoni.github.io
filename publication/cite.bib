	abstract = {The general Art Gallery Problem (AGP) consists in finding the minimum number of guards sufficient to ensure the visibility coverage of an art gallery represented by a polygon. The AGP is a well known ℕℙNP{\textbackslash}mathbb\{NP\}-hard problem and, for this reason, all algorithms proposed so far to solve it are unable to guarantee optimality except in special cases. In this paper, we present a new method for solving the Art Gallery Problem by iteratively generating upper and lower bounds while seeking to reach an exact solution. Notwithstanding that convergence remains an important open question, our algorithm has been successfully tested on a very large collection of instances from publicly available benchmarks. Tests were carried out for several classes of instances totalizing more than a thousand hole-free polygons with sizes ranging from 20 to 1000 vertices. The proposed algorithm showed a remarkable performance, obtaining provably optimal solutions for every instance in a matter of minutes on a standard desktop computer. To our knowledge, despite the AGP having been studied for four decades within the field of computational geometry, this is the first time that an exact algorithm is proposed and extensively tested for this problem. Future research directions to expand the present work are also discussed.},

In particular, we demonstrate how the robot platform IRMA3D can produce high-resolution, virtual 3D environments, based on a limited number of laser scans. Computing an optimal set of scans amounts to solving an instance of the Art Gallery Problem (AGP): Place a minimum number of stationary guards in a polygonal region P, such that all points in P are guarded.},

	abstract = {In the last few decades, the search for exact algorithms for known NP-hard geometric problems has intensified. Many of these solutions use Integer Linear Programming (ILP) modeling and rely on state-of-the- art solvers to be able to find optimal solutions for large instances in a matter of minutes. In this work, we discuss an ILP-based algorithm that solves to optimality the Art Gallery Problem (AGP), one of the most studied problems in computational geometry. The basic idea of our method is to iteratively generate upper and lower bounds for the problem through the resolution of discretized versions of the AGP, which are reduced to instances of the Set Cover Problem. Our algorithm was implemented and tested on almost 3,000 instances and attained optimal solutions for the vast majority of them, greatly increasing the set of instances for which exact solutions are known. To the best of our knowledge, in spite of the extensive study of the AGP in the last four decades, no other algorithm has shown the ability to solve the AGP as effectively and efficiently as the one described here. Evidence of its robustness is presented through tests done on a number of classes of polygons of various sizes with and without holes. A software package implementing the algorithm is made available.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we study an instance of the G-closure problem for two-dimensional periodic metamaterials. Specifically, we consider composites with isotropic homogenized elasticity tensor, obtained as a mixture of two isotropic materials. We focus on the case when one material has zero stiffness, i.e., single-material structures with voids. This problem is important, in particular, in the context of designing small-scale structures for metamaterials that can be manufactured using additive fabrication. A range of effective metamaterial properties can be obtained this way using a single base material. We demonstrate that two closely related simple parametric families based on the structure proposed by Sigmund in [26] attain good coverage of the space of isotropic properties satisfying Hashin–Shtrikman bounds. In particular, for positive Poisson’s ratio, we demonstrate that Hashin–Shtrikman bound can be approximated arbitrarily well, within limits imposed by numerical approximation: a strong evidence that these bounds are achievable in this case. For negative Poisson’s ratios, we numerically obtain a bound which we hypothesize to be close to optimal, at least for metamaterials with rotational symmetries of a regular triangle tiling.},

	abstract = {New fabrication technologies have significantly decreased the cost of fabrication of shapes with highly complex geometric structure. One important application of complex fine-scale geometric structures is to create variable effective elastic material properties in shapes manufactured from a single material. Modification of material properties has a variety of uses, from aerospace applications to soft robotics and prosthetic devices. Due to its scalability and effectiveness, an increasingly common approach to creating spatially varying materials is to partition a shape into cells and use a parametric family of small-scale geometric structures with known effective properties to fill the cells. We propose a new approach to solving this problem for extruded, planar microstructures. Differently from existing methods for two-scale optimization based on regular grids with square periodic cells, which cannot conform to an arbitrary boundary, we introduce cell decompositions consisting of (nearly) rhombic cells. These meshes have far greater flexibility than those with square cells in terms of approximating arbitrary shapes, and, at the same time, have a number of properties simplifying small-scale structure construction. Our main contributions include a new family of 2D cell geometry structures, explicitly parameterized by their effective Young's moduli E, Poisson's ratios v, and rhombic angle α with the geometry parameters expressed directly as smooth spline functions of E, v, and α. This family leads to smooth transitions between the tiles and can handle a broad range of rhombic cell shapes. We introduce a complete material design pipeline based on this microstructure family, composed of an algorithm to generate rhombic tessellation from quadrilateral meshes and an algorithm to synthesize the microstructure geometry. We fabricated a number of models and experimentally demonstrated how our method, in combination with material optimization, can be used to achieve the desired deformation behavior.},

	abstract = {Modern fabrication methods have greatly simplified manufacturing of complex free-form shapes at an affordable cost, and opened up new possibilities for improving functionality and customization through automatic optimization, shape optimization in particular. However, most existing shape optimization methods focus on single parts. In this work, we focus on supporting shape optimization for assemblies, more specifically, assemblies that are held together by contact and friction. Examples of which include furniture joints, construction set assemblies, certain types of prosthetic devices and many other. To enable this optimization, we present a framework supporting robust and accurate optimization of a number of important functionals, while enforcing constraints essential for assembly functionality: weight, stress, difficulty of putting the assembly together, and how reliably it stays together. Our framework is based on smoothed formulation of elasticity equations with contact, analytically derived shape derivatives, and robust remeshing to enable large changes of shape, and at the same time, maintain accuracy. We demonstrate the improvements it can achieve for a number of computational and experimental examples.},
